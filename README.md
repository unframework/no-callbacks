# No Callbacks

Experiment: using React without callbacks.

See [live sandbox demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/unframework/no-callbacks).

## Why?

A lot of people are being introduced to web programming using React. However, managing state, effects and event callbacks are often still tough to grasp, especially for newcomers.

This repo is an experiment in creating safe building blocks that help wire up basic page interactivity with as few bugs and surprises as possible. Some coding skill is still needed, but the goal is to do away with finicky debugging - what you see is what you get.

And the core starting principle is: **no event callbacks!**

## To Do

- nav state (links with hrefs)
- form submit
